###### a webring from paradise

## how to use!

create an `iframe` in your page with a link to the void, example:

```html
<iframe src="https://youcanneverleave.art/?fg=ffffff&bg=000000" width="100%" height="420px"></iframe>
```

you can change the fg(foreground) and bg(background) colors to set the background color to whatever you feel like!
